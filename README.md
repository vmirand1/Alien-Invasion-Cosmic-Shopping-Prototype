# Alien-Invasion-Cosmic-Shopping-Prototype
# You play as a Alien that disguises themselves as a human to shop for things on earth. Once the objective is complete you find the spaceship and report back to the commander to hopefully get a raise. Be cautious of the law enforcement that roams around. If they catch you, you will be arrested. Keep an eye on the timer if you don't want to be left behind by the spaceship.
